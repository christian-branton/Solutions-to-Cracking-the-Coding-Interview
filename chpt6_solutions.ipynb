With the first egg, procede to drop it at floor $\\Delta f$, $2 \\Delta f$, $\\ldots$.  Say this egg breaks at $k \\Delta f$.  Then, with the remaining egg, do a linear scan from $(k-1) \\Delta f +1$ to $k\\Delta f -1$. In the worst case, we must do $\\Delta f -1$ drops for the first egg and $\\Delta f - 1$ drops for the second egg.  For example, if $\\Delta f = 8$, then, in the worst case, the egg will break on the 12th toss of the first egg at floor 96.

    "On the first pass, all lockers which are a multiple of 1 get toggled.  On the second, all lockers which are a multiple of 2 get toggled.  On the third, all lockers which are a multiple of 3 get toggled and so forth.  If we consider any individual locker $i$, we know that all divisors of that locker number come in pairs about $sqrt(i)$.  For example for $i=78$, the pairs are $(1, 78), (2, 39), (5, 26), (6, 13)$.  Thus, for every toggle, there is an \"untoggle\" that undoes that action.  The only exception is when $i$ is a perfect square.  In this case, there is 1 divisor namely $\\sqrt{i}$ which does not have a partner.  For example, for $i=36$, the divisors are $(1, 36), (2, 18), (3, 4), (6, 6)$.  Thus, for the first 3 tuples I have enumerated, the locker gets toggled then untoggled.  But for the last, it gets toggled only once.  Therefore, the only lockers that are open in the end are those which are perfect squares: $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81$ and $100$."

    "We can get the results back in 1 week.  Take an easy example of 6 bottles and 3 test strips.  Convert the bottle number to it binary representation (001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110) and assign strip 1 to the first (rightmost) bit, strip 2 to the second bit and strip 3 to the leftmost bit.  For all bottles, if the bit is a 1, but a drop on the corresponding strip.  Under this strategy, the table below summarizes the test results for strip 1, 2 and 3 if the poisned bottle is bottle 1, 2, etc...  In the table, I have indicated a positive result with a 1 and a negative result with a zero.  For example if the poisson is in bottle 4, then the fact that we have dropped bottles 1-3, and 5-6 onto the strips will not affect the outcome (they will be negative).  For bottle 4, we have only dropped it on strip 3, and therefore strips 2 and 1 will be negative, while strip 3 will be positive.  Note that the result code corresponds exactly to the bottle code which contains the poisson, so that we can identify immediately which bottle is poisned.   \n",
