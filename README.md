Here are my Python solutions (mostly in Jupyter notebooks) to most of Gayle Laakmann McDowell's: Cracking the Coding Interview.  This is a great book if you are looking for challenging algorithms questions.

Although I can't promise my solutions are always the most efficient in terms of time and space complexity, for many of the problems I present more than one solution if something more efficient comes to mind.  I have made an effort to analyze the time and space complexity for almost all of my solutions, and I have also made an effort ensure correctness by testing on many examples.

Most solutions are presented with explanations in Latex.  Github does not seem to be the greatest at rendering Latex equations, so if you are interested in the math just download the notebooks and run them in a browser yourself.
